        <h1>Hey, I'm [Your Name]</h1>
        <p>I'm a designer-engineer hybrid drawn to the intersection of physical systems, user interaction, and visual storytelling. I love taking abstract technical concepts and turning them into tangible, intuitive experiences.</p>

        <p>My work spans wearable health tools, diffusion-based control models, and speculative fashion. I'm currently exploring how research, craft, and aesthetics can co-exist in hybrid workflows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ðŸ”§ Building human-centered hardware with real-world constraints</li>
          <li>ðŸ§  Investigating biomechanics, control theory, and generative AI</li>
          <li>ðŸŽ¨ Fabricating garments and creative direction for editorial shoots</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Outside of projects, I enjoy dancing, baking, and making one-off designs for friends. If you'd like to chat, feel free to <a href="mailto:you@example.com">email me</a> or download my <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
