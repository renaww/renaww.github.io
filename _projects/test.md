This project began with a user-centered design process focused on accessibility in urban environments. Our collaborator, who is deaf, highlighted the challenge of not being able to hear sirens while driving.

We designed a compact, dashboard-mounted device using a microphone array and LED indicators to alert the driver when sirens are detected, improving safety and awareness.

**Tools:** Arduino, Python (sound classification), CAD, user testing
