Odessa is a helpful kit for prototyping responsive websites and boosting up your design workflow in Sketch.

We designed a compact, dashboard-mounted device using a microphone array and LED indicators to alert the driver when sirens are detected, improving safety and awareness.

**Tools:** Arduino, Python (sound classification), CAD, user testing
